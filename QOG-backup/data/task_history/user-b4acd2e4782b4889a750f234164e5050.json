The current deadline is [Original Due Date, if you know it, otherwise omit or state \"approaching soon\"].\n\nDue to [brief, honest reason, e.g., an unexpected technical issue / a higher-priority task emerging / a personal commitment], I need a little more time to ensure I can complete it thoroughly and to the high standard we expect.\n\nI would be grateful if I could submit the project by **October 31st**. I am confident I can deliver a complete and high-quality submission by this revised deadline.\n\nThank you for considering my request. Please let me know if this new deadline works for you or if you need any further information from my end.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n```\n\n**Actionable Guidance:**\n*   **Replace `[Original Due Date, if you know it...]`** with the actual original deadline if you have it. If not, stating \"approaching soon\" or just omitting the original date is fine.\n*   **Fill in `[brief, honest reason...]`** with a concise and professional explanation. Avoid oversharing, but be truthful.\n*   **Ensure `[Your Name]`** is your full name.",

To give you the best options, consider what kind of message you want to convey and what your photo features.\n\nHere are a few caption ideas, ranging from short and sweet to more reflective:\n\n*   **For a simple, bright message:**\n    *   \"Happy Diwali! \u2728 May your celebrations be as bright as the lights.\"\n    *   \"Wishing you a sparkling Diwali filled with joy and laughter.\"\n*   **For a more traditional or spiritual tone:**\n    *   \"May the divine light of Diwali bring peace, prosperity, and happiness to your life. Shubh Diwali!\"\n    *   \"Celebrating the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil. Happy Diwali to all!\"\n*   **Focusing on new beginnings and prosperity:**\n    *   \"May this Diwali usher in new beginnings, abundant prosperity, and endless joy. Happy Diwali!\"\n    *   \"Wishing you a year ahead filled with success, health, and happiness. Happy Diwali!\"\n\nTo refine your choice, think about:\n*   **Your photo's focus:** Is it diyas, rangoli, family, or food?\n*   **Your audience:** Are you sharing with close friends or a wider network?\n*   **Your personal style:** Do you prefer humor, sincerity, or elegance?\n\nLet me know if you'd like to refine any of these or if you have a specific photo in mind, and I can help you tailor it further!",
