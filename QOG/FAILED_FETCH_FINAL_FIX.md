# "Failed to Fetch" Error - FINAL FIX ✅

## The Real Issue
The `VITE_API_URL` environment variable was being passed to `docker-compose` but **NOT to the Dockerfile build process**. This meant:
- ❌ The Dockerfile didn't have an `ARG` declaration for `VITE_API_URL`
- ❌ The build was silently ignoring the environment variable
- ❌ The frontend was built with the hardcoded fallback: `http://localhost:5050/api`
- ❌ When deployed to production at `http://35.238.253.107`, it couldn't reach the API

## The Solution

### Updated frontend/Dockerfile
Added proper ARG handling:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Accept build argument for API URL
ARG VITE_API_URL=http://localhost/api
ENV VITE_API_URL=${VITE_API_URL}

# ... rest of Dockerfile
RUN npm run build  # This now uses the VITE_API_URL variable
```

### How it works:
1. `docker-compose.yml` passes `VITE_API_URL` as a build ARG
2. Dockerfile accepts it with `ARG VITE_API_URL=...`
3. It's exported as `ENV` so the build process sees it
4. `npm run build` (Vite) bakes this URL into the JavaScript bundle
5. Frontend JS now uses `http://35.238.253.107/api` instead of localhost

## Deployment
Rebuilt with correct API URL:
```bash
VITE_API_URL='http://35.238.253.107/api' docker compose build frontend
```

### Verification
✅ JavaScript bundle now contains correct API URL:
```
http://35.238.253.107/api (appears 4+ times in bundle)
```

✅ Authentication endpoints working:
```
POST /api/auth/signup → 200/409 OK ✅
```

✅ CORS headers present:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * ✅
```

## Testing
Try it now at: **http://35.238.253.107**

You should now be able to:
- ✅ Sign up with new account (no failed to fetch)
- ✅ Login with credentials
- ✅ Access dashboard
- ✅ All API calls working

## Technical Summary
| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Frontend Build | ✅ Uses correct API URL |
| Nginx Routing | ✅ All /api/* → backend:5000 |
| CORS Headers | ✅ Properly set |
| Backend Health | ✅ Running and responding |
| Docker Compose | ✅ Properly passing build args |

If you still see "Failed to fetch", try:
1. **Hard refresh** browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** for 35.238.253.107
3. **Check browser console** (F12 > Console tab) for any errors
