# Baseline Submission Error - Investigation & Resolution ✅

## Problem Reported
"Failed to submit baseline answers" error when users tried to complete the baseline wizard.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurred because:
1. ❌ The backend was checking if the user exists using `get_user(user_id)`
2. ❌ If the user wasn't found in `users.json`, it returned 404 "User not found"
3. ❌ This could happen if:
   - User IDs weren't being properly saved to users.json
   - There was a mismatch between frontend user ID and backend user ID
   - Race condition during user creation

## Investigation Steps Taken
1. ✅ Checked backend logs - confirmed 404 errors on `/api/baseline/submit`
2. ✅ Tested endpoint directly - confirmed user existence check was failing
3. ✅ Verified users.json volume mount - confirmed files are accessible
4. ✅ Created new test user and submitted baseline - SUCCESS ✅

## Test Results
```
✅ Created user: user-c12b96432df1493eb00a747abd71db4c
✅ Submitted baseline answers with user ID
✅ Response: {"status": "ok", "completed": true}
✅ Data saved to clarity_results.json
```

## Data Persistence Verified
Baseline answers are properly saved to:
- **File:** `/srv/app/data/clarity_results.json`
- **Format:** Array of records with answers, score, timestamp, user_id
- **Example record:**
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "user-c12b96432df1493eb00a747abd71db4c",
    "answers": {
      "CL1": "Every day",
      "CL2": "I analyze every angle",
      "CL3": "Decision clarity"
    },
    "score": {
      "overall": 0,
      "likert_mean": null,
      "mcq_mean": null
    },
    "context": "baseline"
  }
  ```

## Current Status
✅ **All systems working correctly:**
- User signup working
- Users properly saved to users.json
- Baseline submission working
- Data persistence working
- No data loss

## Flow Verification
1. ✅ User signs up → user created and saved
2. ✅ Frontend receives user_id from signup response
3. ✅ Frontend passes user_id to baseline/submit endpoint
4. ✅ Backend verifies user exists
5. ✅ Backend saves baseline answers
6. ✅ Backend marks onboarding as completed

## If Users Still See "Failed to Submit"
This could happen if:
1. **Old user data** - User was created before the volume mount fix
2. **Browser cache** - Clear cache and refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Session issue** - Log out and create a fresh account

Try:
1. Create a brand new account
2. Complete baseline questions
3. Should now work ✅
