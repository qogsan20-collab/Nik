# Login Screen "Failed to Fetch" Error - Fix Complete ✅

## Problem Reported
Users were getting "Failed to fetch" errors on the login/signup screen.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **two-fold**:

### 1. **Frontend API URL Configuration**
- The frontend was built without knowing the correct API URL
- It was falling back to `http://localhost:5050/api` (hardcoded fallback)
- This didn't work when deployed to production via Nginx

### 2. **Nginx Configuration Error**
- The `nginx.conf` file contained `events` and `http` blocks
- These blocks are **not allowed** in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` includes
- This caused Nginx to fail to start with error: `"events" directive is not allowed here`

## The Solution

### Part 1: Update docker-compose.yml
Added `VITE_API_URL` as a build argument to the frontend service:
```yaml
frontend:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: frontend/Dockerfile
    args:
      - VITE_API_URL=${VITE_API_URL:-http://localhost/api}
```

### Part 2: Fix nginx.conf  
Removed the `events` and `http` blocks and converted it to a valid `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` include file:
- **Kept:** `server` block, proxy settings, security headers, routing
- **Removed:** `events`, `http`, upstream directives
- **Fixed proxy path:** Changed `proxy_pass http://backend` to `proxy_pass http://backend:5000`

### Part 3: Deploy with Correct API URL
Rebuilt frontend with the external IP:
```bash
VITE_API_URL='http://35.238.253.107/api' docker compose build frontend
```

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Frontend rebuilt with correct API URL
- ✅ Nginx configuration fixed (no more config errors)
- ✅ Both frontend and backend containers healthy and running
- ✅ API endpoints tested and working:
  - `/api/health` → 200 OK ✅
  - `/api/auth/signup` → 200 OK ✅

## Testing
Access your application at: **http://35.238.253.107**

You should now be able to:
- ✅ Sign up with new account
- ✅ Log in with existing credentials
- ✅ No more "Failed to fetch" errors
- ✅ Backend API responds correctly

## Technical Details
- **Frontend Build Arg:** `VITE_API_URL` baked into production build
- **Nginx Routing:** All `/api/*` requests proxied to `backend:5000`
- **Frontend Serving:** Static files served from `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- **Frontend URL Handling:** Uses `http://35.238.253.107/api` to reach backend
