# Reasoning Styles Bug Fix - Deployment Complete ✅

## Problem Identified
The Clarity Dashboard was displaying all 8 domains (including behavioral traits like Trust, Reliance, Confidence) in the "Top Reasoning Style" section. However, only 3 domains should appear as reasoning styles:
- **Analytical**
- **Critical Thinking** 
- **Cognitive Flexibility**

The other 5 domains are behavioral traits or other reasoning types:
- **Inductive & Deductive** (reasoning types)
- **Trust, Reliance, Confidence** (behavioral traits - should only appear as separate gauge cards)

## Root Cause
The code was finding the highest-scoring domain overall WITHOUT filtering, which allowed behavioral traits to be displayed as top reasoning styles when they scored high.

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes in `src/components/ClarityDashboard.tsx`:

1. **Added filter set for reasoning styles** (Line ~53):
   ```typescript
   const reasoningStyleDomains = new Set<string>(reasoningDisplayOrder);
   const isReasoningStyle = (domain: string) => reasoningStyleDomains.has(domain);
   ```

2. **Updated topDomain calculation** (Lines ~494-502):
   - Now filters `domainSummaries` to only include reasoning styles before finding the highest
   - Prevents behavioral traits from appearing as top reasoning style

3. **Updated radarData generation** (Lines ~542-551):
   - Filters domain summaries to only reasoning styles
   - Radar chart now displays only Analytical, Critical, and Flexibility (not all 8 domains)

### Result
The dashboard now properly segregates:
- **Reasoning Styles Section**: Shows only Analytical, Critical Thinking, Cognitive Flexibility
- **Behavioral Traits Section**: Shows Trust and Reliance as separate gauge cards
- **Radar Chart**: Displays only the 3 reasoning styles

## Frontend Dockerfile Fix
Updated `/frontend/Dockerfile` to use `npm ci` (without `--only=production`) to ensure all dev dependencies like Vite are installed during build.

## Deployment
- ✅ Frontend built successfully with new changes
- ✅ Docker containers rebuilt and deployed
- ✅ Both backend and frontend healthy and running
- ✅ Changes live on production

## Testing
Access the dashboard at: `http://35.238.253.107`
Verify that:
1. Top Reasoning Style shows only one of the 3 reasoning styles
2. Secondary reasoning style cards show the other 2 reasoning styles
3. Gauge cards display Trust and Reliance separately
4. Radar chart shows only the 3 reasoning styles
